# react-locus (EXPERIMENTAL)

**This is an extremely experimental library. Do not use it in your projects.
It is unstable, untested, and the performance is known to be terrible.
Please, do not use this tool.**

`react-locus` provides contextual information about your React components and
their location in relation to its siblings.

You can use it to emulate the CSS selectors `:first-child`, `:nth-child`,
and `:last-child` in a platform agnostic way
(if you're targeting both web and `react-native`)

There is no documentation for this as it is highly experimental, but
please check out the examples folder if you're interested in how it works.
